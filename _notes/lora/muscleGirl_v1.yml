lora: muscleGirl_v1.safetensors
prompt: <lora:muscleGirl_v1:1>
triggers:
  - muscular
  - muscular female
  - thighs
  - fit
  - abs
  - leg muscles
  - arm muscles
  - back muscles
notes:
  - Common muscle-related prompts may work, including abs, leg muscles, arm muscles, and back muscles.
  - Without the need for trigger words, this LoRA can also fix body shape.
  - Not good at generating hyper muscles.
  - Add Prompt "navel" makes abs look better IMO.
  - if there are unexpected bikini strings around hips, add "shimakaze \(kancolle\)" or"high leg" to the negative prompts may help get rid of them, sometimes.
